# Building Modern Web Applications with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications faster and more efficient than ever before. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and how to leverage them in your projects.

## What's New in Next.js 14

### App Router Improvements
The App Router continues to evolve with better performance and developer experience improvements. The latest version includes:

- Enhanced routing performance
- Improved error handling
- Better TypeScript support
- Streamlined data fetching

### Server Actions
Server Actions provide a powerful way to handle server-side logic directly from your components:

```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')
  
  // Handle post creation
  await savePost({ title, content })
}
```

### Partial Prerendering
This experimental feature allows you to combine static and dynamic content in the same route, providing the best of both worlds.

## Best Practices for Next.js 14

1. **Use Server Components by Default**: Start with Server Components and only use Client Components when necessary
2. **Optimize Images**: Always use next/image for automatic optimization
3. **Implement Proper Loading States**: Use Suspense and loading.tsx files
4. **Type Everything**: Leverage TypeScript for better development experience

## Performance Optimization Tips

- Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use Server Actions for form handling

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in web development, offering improved performance, better developer experience, and powerful new features. Start incorporating these features into your projects today!
